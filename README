JAceBenchmark is my personal benchmark suite.
I use it to benchmark a few aspects of a PC's performance.
The main focus is on aspects which are important to software developers.
For example, they measure the translation performance of C compilers or JVMs.
Some of the benchmarks are independent of the operating system.
Some require a real Linux system.
Some require a POSIX system, and on Windows thus require something like Cygwin.
Some require a JVM.
